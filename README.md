# Bevy Game

Currently, this is a demo project to help me understand the basics of the 
[Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/). As stated on the Bevy website, Bevy is a 'refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust'. 

### Game Overview
This is a top-down, 2D style shooter game. 

### Current Game State
Currently, the player is able to move, sprint and shoot. The enemies are able to start tracking the player once the player has moved within the 'trigger radius' of the enemy.
